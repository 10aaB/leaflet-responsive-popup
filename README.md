## Leaflet Responsive Popup

This plugin overrides [L.Popup](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.2.html#popup) to remove the need to move the map to be able to see the content of the popup. This happens when opening a popup near an edge of the map.

Here is a [Demo](https://yafred.github.io/leaflet-responsive-popup/default-marker).




This was inspired by [Rrose: A Leaflet Plugin for Edge Cases](https://github.com/erictheise/rrose).
