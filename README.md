## Responsive Popup

This was inspired by [Rrose: A Leaflet Plugin for Edge Cases](https://github.com/erictheise/rrose).

This plugin overrides [L.Popup](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.2.html#popup) to remove the need to move the map to be able to see the content of the popup. This happens when opening a popup near an edge of the map.
