## Leaflet Responsive Popup

If you don't want the map to move to show the popup, you need L.ResponsivePopup

![Leaflet L.Popup]({{ '/assets/images/leaflet-popup.png' | absolute_url }})
![Leaflet L.ResponsivePopup]({{ '/assets/images/leaflet-responsive-popup.png' | absolute_url }})

Here is a [Demo]({{ '/default-marker' | absolute_url }}).
